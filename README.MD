# PoC DMA Game Cheat for IW9
This is a proof of concept cheat, which was ported from my private project using driver exploits. PCIe communication is slower than local socket communication, hence there might be performance issues, which are solved by utilizing scatter read capabilities of pcileech.

## Installation
- Get a PCILeech compatible DMA card. Get d3xx drivers.
- Use on main(game) PC or a second PC.

## Features
- ESP (Players, Items)
- Two aimbot versions with custom settings
- High Alert Perk imitation
- Player names and weapon types (AR,SM,PI etc)
- Player look direction on ESP
- External radar window
- Mini map radar
- Opacity, map zoom and ESP render distance settings
- SkillIndex - see how you did compared to others in your lobbies
- Bypassing of IW9 pointer encryption
- AFK mode
